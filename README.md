This is a [Maubot](https://github.com/maubot/maubot) plugin for use in a [Matrix](https://matrix.org/) chat room. The plugin allows you to define arbitrary emoji reactions that will cause messages tagged with the specified emoji to be automatically cross-posted to a different room.

You'll need to create a config.yaml (based on [example-config.yaml](example-config.yaml)) to specify mappings. For example:
```
mapping:
  ðŸš‹: public_transportation
```
Will cause any message tagged with the train emoji ðŸš‹ to be posted to the local room with the alias #public_transportation. You can define as many actions as you want, although currently the system is limited to posting to one room per emoji reaction.

Note the YAML parser is fussy and needs a space after the colon for the mapping to work correctly.

## TODO items

* add in-room commands to define mappings
* allow custom template for cross-posting
* cull back unnecessary libraries
* allow multiple room posting with single emoji
